# MonteCarloSim-Via-PythonMCerp-Example
This is a simple example of how to run a Monte Carlo Simulation to develop a Budget Cost Risk Analysis via a Python Library called MCerp 

MCerp < https://pythonhosted.org/mcerp/ > is a stochastic calculator for Monte Carlo methods that uses latin-hypercube sampling to perform non-order specific error propagation (or uncertainty analysis). With this package you can easily and transparently track the effects of uncertainty through mathematical calculations.
